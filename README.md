This is the code repository for [Modern Frontend Development with Node.js](https://www.packtpub.com/product/modern-frontend-development-with-nodejs/9781804618295), published by Packt.

**The compendium for web development within the Node.js ecosystem**

## What is this book about?

Almost a decade after releasing Node.js, the tooling used by frontend developers is fully embracing the cross-platform JavaScript runtime. In this book, you'll learn to leverage Node.js to the maximum for creating frontend applications.

After learning the basics and internals of Node.js, you will be ready to divide your code into modules and packages. You'll get to know the most popular package managers and their areas of use. Likewise, you'll also learn how different flavors of JavaScript, such as TypeScript, can be used with Node.js. The right tooling is crucial, which is why you'll dive into all of the available state of the art tools. You'll get in touch with linters such as eslint or formatters like Prettier. No matter if you have never heard of a bundler or call yourself a Webpack wizard - the section about bundlers will teach you everything you need to know about the Swiss army knife of frontend development: bundlers. For code quality verification, you'll also get in touch with a variety of testing utilities like Jest.

In the final part of the book, you'll see how easy it is to publish your code in reusable packages. Finally, you'll also become an expert in choosing the right code structure for your repositories by learning about monorepos.

This book covers the following exciting features:

* Practically develop a frontend application with Node.js based tools and libraries
* Use bundlers such as Webpack or Vite to create efficient web applications
* Leverage test runners like Jest to ship reliable software
* Organize code repositories to work in close collaboration with other developers and teams
* Learn to publish npm packages to make code reuse much simpler
* Improve code quality by enabling consistent formatting using Prettier
